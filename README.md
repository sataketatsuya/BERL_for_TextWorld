It is recommended to install the conda virtual environment.

You can install conda command on Linux [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html)

```
cd BERL_FOR_TEXTWORLD

conda create -n berl python=3.7 numpy scipy ipython matplotlib pandas scikit-learn seaborn
conda activate berl
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit -c pytorch

pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m nltk.downloader 'punkt'
```

Download textworld dataset. You can check the dataset detail at [First TextWorld Problems Competition website](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21557#learn_the_details-data).
```
wget https://aka.ms/ftwp/dataset.zip
unzip dataset.zip
```

## Model training

To train the models run the following command with the folder having the games but you must download dataset.zip from the Textworld Competition wensite.

```
python src/runtrain.py --games_path ./games
```

This will output to the screen the game with the agent commands. You can also execute the command with a folder having several games.

## Test agent

In the competition the agent executed in an environment without Apex. To test create a new env without Apex and run the following command

```
python src/playgame.py --display ./games/test
```
## Ner model
